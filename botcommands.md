# Interacting with the bot on Telegram

There are a handful of commands that the APRSBot will understand:

* /help - This will list all the commands the bot recognizes. Basically this help file.
* /find <callsign> - Pull last found position for a station. <callsign> is either callsign or callsign-ssid (Example: AA0ABC or AA0ABC-9)
* /msg <callsign> <message text> - Send a message to an APRS Station. <callsign> is the destination callsign and is either callsign or callsign-ssid (Example: AA0ABC or AA0ABC-9) and message text is the message you want to send.

* To send your current location, click the paperclip, select location and then select send current location. You will get a map image showing your current location and it will be sent to the APRS-IS System
